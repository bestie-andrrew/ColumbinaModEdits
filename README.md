# ColumbinaModEdits
## IMPORTANT
To preface: the original mod and all its assets are ***NOT MINE.*** The original concept was authored by @Kainsillybilly on GameBanana-- the original mod page is [here.](https://gamebanana.com/mods/619527) 

Furthermore, the attached .zip file is purposefully incomplete, as I've opted to allow access to _supplemental update material_ rather than sidestepping the original creator's page. To use my update materials, download the original mod's .zip from the link above and replace applicable files with those from this repository. 

## Regarding Optional Files:
Optional Files/ColumbinaBodyDiffuse is a slight edit I made to make the white accents on Columbina's outfit slightly pink-toned. Simply replace it in this mod's folder. 

## Note to the Original Author
Hello, my friend! 

I'm not certain if you've seen before now, but since your original post in ver 6.0, I've been sharing my personal upkeep of your mod through a Google Drive link in the comments of your post. I wanted to reach out to you personally before I made that decision, but couldn't find anywhere I could contact you. If you have any issue with me doing this in your stead, please feel free to reach out to me. My discord is listed on my GB profile. I'm happy to remove any + all uploaded resources you'd like upon request-- I want to put my respect for you as a fellow artist front-and-center here. 

Thank you for authoring this mod to begin with. Cheers! :)
